# 🔧 Fix Rankings Issue - SOLVED ✅

## Problem ❌
Individual user ranks showed incorrect positions:
- Rad1kall: rank 1 ✅ 
- Miss Grace: rank 3 ❌ (should be 2)
- MyAngelPhos: rank 5 ❌ (should be 3)

Leaderboard API showed correct positions (1, 2, 3) but individual user stats showed (1, 3, 5).

## Root Cause 🔍
Redis sorted sets contained stale entries from deleted/restricted users, causing rank gaps.
`!flushcache` didn't fix the issue.

## Solution That Worked ✅

### Manual Redis Fix
Clear Redis leaderboard manually:

```bash
# Find Redis container
docker ps | grep redis

# Clear leaderboard keys (correct format without "sunrise:" prefix)
docker exec -it osu-sunrise-redis-1 redis-cli DEL leaderboard:global:0
docker exec -it osu-sunrise-redis-1 redis-cli DEL leaderboard:country:0:100

# Restart services
cd /home/ubuntu/Sunrise
docker compose restart
```

## Result ✅
After clearing Redis and restart:
- Miss Grace: rank 2 ✅ (fixed from 3)
- MyAngelPhos: rank 3 ✅ (fixed from 5)

## Quick Fix for Future
If this happens again, just run:
```bash
docker exec -it osu-sunrise-redis-1 redis-cli DEL leaderboard:global:0
docker exec -it osu-sunrise-redis-1 redis-cli KEYS "leaderboard:country:0:*" # then delete each key
cd /home/ubuntu/Sunrise && docker compose restart
```
